This repository contains a Flutter client and a Flask server.
The code is used to test how Gemini cli works 

## Client (Flutter)

Located in the `client` directory.

To run:
1. Navigate to the `client` directory: `cd client`
2. Get dependencies: `flutter pub get`
3. Run the app: `flutter run`

## Server (Flask)

Located in the `server` directory.

To run:
1. Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd server`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the app: `python app.py`


## tools 

Gemini CLI and android studio (instead of kotlin, I used Flutter for the first time). I tried a few days learning Kotlin and trying to generate partial code without good progress. Should have switched to this approach earlier. 

Learning
- The flutter code is slightly easier to read. Build failure is the main headache for more complex app so I switched to this app that couldn't be simpler.
